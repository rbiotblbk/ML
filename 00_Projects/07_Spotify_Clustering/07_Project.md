# Spority Clustering Program
(Real life Project)

## Clustering as a human (without python)

### Steps
1. Hear the 10x music files from the Spority Website. You will find the music links in the df_audio_features_10.csv column (html)
2. Try to find which songs are similar to each other .. Example . song1 and song 5 are similar
3. Read after that the description file and understand the features

Result: 
- Example . song1 and song 5 are similar
- Example . song3, song2 and song 8 are similar




## Clustering with Algorithms

Use KMEANS for cluster the rows

### Steps
1. Drop all unnecessary columns
2. use KMEAN to cluster the data
3. Try to use Elbow and Silh. score to determin the cluster count
